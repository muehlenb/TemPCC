At the time of writing and evaluating the paper, TemPCC was part of a larger project. Currently, TemPCC is being refactored into a standalone component. For transparency, we are publishing the original, unrefactored classes used in this larger project for training and evaluation. These classes will be removed after the refactoring is complete, but they will remain accessible via the Git history.
